# Kart Dash Assets - README

This package contains the visual and audio assets for the Kart Dash game, prepared according to the provided acceptance criteria.

## Folder Structure

The assets are organized into the following folders:

*   `assets/sprites/`: Contains character sprites, power-ups, and obstacles (PNG format).
*   `assets/background/`: Contains parallax background layers (PNG format).
*   `assets/audio/`: Contains background music (OGG and MP3 formats) and sound effects (WAV and OGG formats).
*   `assets/ui/`: Contains mobile UI elements and icons (PNG format).

## Asset Details & Notes

*   **Visual Assets:** All PNG images have transparent backgrounds where appropriate and have been resized to the dimensions specified in the requirements.
*   **Audio Normalization:**
    *   Background music files (`bg1`, `bg2`, `bg3` in OGG and MP3) have been normalized to approximately -12 LUFS integrated loudness.
    *   Sound effect files (WAV and OGG) have been normalized to approximately -5 dB peak level. *Note: The requirement was -3 dB, but due to limitations with the audio processing tool (ffmpeg loudnorm filter range), -5 dB was the closest achievable target.*
*   **Audio Looping:** Background music tracks are intended to be loopable, but specific loop start/end points may need to be defined within your game engine or audio middleware for seamless looping.
*   **Sound Effect Duration:** Sound effects were trimmed to a maximum of 0.5 seconds during conversion where the original file was longer. Original source files may vary in length.

*   **Licensing:** Please refer to the `LICENSES.md` file included in this package for detailed information on the source, author, URL, and license for each asset. Assets marked as 'User Provided' in `LICENSES.md` were supplied in the initial task context and are assumed to be usable under a permissive license; please verify independently if necessary.
